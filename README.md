# Air-Quality-Index-Level-Prediction-Using-Random-Forest-Algorithm-on-Cluster-Computing-of-Spark

Developed a rapid and detailed Air Quality Index (AQI) level prediction method based on the implementation of distributed random forest computation using Apache Spark. Employing the parallel processing capabilities of Apache Spark, we executed a distributed random forest calculation. Within the program, a threshold θ was established, and when the size of the model data compared to the total data exceeded this threshold, the computation process transitioned from worker to driver. This threshold θ significantly accelerates decision tree development, as the computation requires more time than the estimation process. To evaluate the performance of our proposed approach, we conducted multiple experiments using historical meteorological data from Beijing. The results demonstrated that our method achieves high Precision and Recall values. Furthermore, we showcased the time efficiency and scalability of our proposed methodology when handling extensive datasets.
